The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."],"metadata":{"id":"CjqzgdT1FY8H"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###2.
