(The name is a reference to panel data, not the animal.) It gives us data frames, which represent data in a table of columns and rows, and functions to manipulate and plot them. `pandas` also provides a slew of functions for reading and writing data to a variety of sources, including files, SQL databases, and compressed binary formats."],"id":"4339b9f2"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cea5f938"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","# pd is the conventional alias for pandas\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# display all columns\n","pd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\", None)"],"id":"cea5f938"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4891c551"},"source":["## DataFrames\n","\n","Columns are labeled with their names. Rows also have a label, or _index_. If row labels are not specified, `pandas` uses numbers as the default. Each column is a _Series_, or one-dimensional array, where values share a data type. Unlike `numpy` arrays, DataFrames can have columns of different data types.

To select a single column in a DataFrame, we can supply the name of the column in square brackets, just like we did when accessing values in a dictionary. `pandas` will return the column as a Series. To get unique values, we can use the `unique()` Series method.
